            <h2>About</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My programming journey began in 2019 with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="blank">Free Code Camp</a>, and now I have a bachelors degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.keene.edu/" target="blank">Keene State College</a>. I'm passionate about the internet and understanding complex systems, and I love to create.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I am building a full-stack application with React, Tailwind, ASP.NET, C#, RESTful APIs, and Docker in order to become more familiar with these technologies and concepts. I strive to constantly learn and improve so I can truly be my best.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When I'm not programming, I like to produce electronic bass music, DJ, make 3D animations, play video games, and watch shows.</p>

I'm currently finishing up my debut album and it's music videos, as well as building a merch shop for the site.</p>
