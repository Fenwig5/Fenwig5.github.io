    <p>I'm Timothy C Stockton II </p>
    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>It's a little rough right now as I am still building it, but this will be where I display my web design and internet programming projects.</p>
    <br>
    <p>First off, this is my live website for my artist alias: <a href="https://pandemica.online" target="blank">Pandemica Online</a></p>
    <p>I have been producing and DJing for several years now and am always working on more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here is a <a href="javascript_calculator.html">JavaScript Calculator</a>
    <p>It is currently very bad at math so I have signed it up for lessons.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Want to find a good quote? Check out my <a href="random_quote_machine.html">Random Quote Machine</a>
    <p>There's only a few quotes loded into it right now.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Do you also like music? Play around with this <a href="drum_machine.html">Drum Machine</a>
    <p>Actually, I need to change the batteries so maybe another time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here is a <a href="markdown_previewer.html">Markdown Previewer</a>
    <p>But it only understands elvish and is illiterate.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have several other projects that I need to finish and/or set up to be displayable on a web page.</p>
    <p>I also need to fix/improve my currently displayed projects and make this site itself visually pleasing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Many of these projects were made for <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/electronictech55" target="blank">Free Code Camp</a></p>
    <p>I previously completed 3 certifications there: Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures, Front End Development Libraries</p>
    <p>As I was just learning, I submitted the required projects with barely more than the minimum requirements.</p>
    <p>Now that I know a lot more I am going back through and improving the projects to be presentable and fully functional.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am 3 semesters away from graduating from <a href="https://www.keene.edu/" target="blank">Keene State College</a> with a Bachelors degree (Computer Science major and a minor in math)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thought's on this site? Please, submit a <a href="survey_form.html">feedback survey</a></p>
    <p>[above survey does not actually submit to anywhere yet]</p>
